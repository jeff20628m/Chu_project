This kernel is modified from the “starter kernel” by Megan Risdal<br>

### **Question:**
**Can you predict whether a patient should be treated of his/her mental illness or not according to the values obtained in the dataset?**

This is my first kernel after taking several courses of ML. I'm trying to understand better every concept by practicing and Kaggle is a good place to do it. Thanks Kaggle team.
